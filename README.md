# üåæ AGROGUIDE : Navigating Smarter Farming Solutions

The **Crop and Fertilizer Predictor** is a machine learning‚Äìpowered web platform designed to help farmers choose the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on **soil nutrients (NPK), pH, rainfall, and city-specific weather conditions.**  
It provides tailored recommendations that reduce resource wastage, improve crop yield, and promote sustainable farming.

## ‚ú® Features

- Input soil parameters (**Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, pH**).  
- Predict best-suited crops for given soil & climate.  
- Suggest fertilizers (**type & quantity**) for selected crop.  
- Real-time **weather API integration**.  
- User-friendly web interface built with **Flask & Bootstrap**.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Enter the corresponding **nutrient values of your soil, state and city**.  
- The **N-P-K** (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium) values should be entered as their ratio.  
- When entering the **city name**, make sure it is a **common city** (remote towns may not be available in the Weather API).  

### Fertilizer Suggestion System  
- Enter the **nutrient contents of your soil** and the **crop you want to grow**.  
- The algorithm will detect nutrient **deficiency/excess** and recommend suitable fertilizers accordingly.
